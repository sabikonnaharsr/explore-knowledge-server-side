        "description": "In the early summer of 2004 I got a phone call from Steve Jobs. He had been scattershot friendly to me over the years, with occasional bursts of intensity, especially when he was launching a new product that he wanted on the cover of Time or featured on CNN, places where I’d worked. But now that I was no longer at either of those places, I hadn’t heard from him much. We talked a bit about the Aspen Institute, which I had recently joined, and I invited him to speak at our summer campus in Colorado. He’d be happy to come, he said, but not to be onstage. He wanted instead to take a walk so that we could talk.That seemed a bit odd. I didn’t yet know that taking a long walk was his preferred way to have a serious conversation. It turned out that he wanted me to write a biography of him. I had recently published one on Benjamin Franklin and was writing one about Albert Einstein, and my initial reaction was to wonder, half jokingly, whether he saw himself as the natural successor in that sequence. Because I assumed that he was still in the middle of an oscillating career that had many more ups and downs left, I demurred. Not now, I said. Maybe in a decade or two, when you retire.I had known him since 1984, when he came to Manhattan to have lunch with Time’s editors and extol his new Macintosh. He was petulant even then, attacking a Time correspondent for having wounded him with a story that was too revealing. But talking to him afterward, I found myself rather captivated, as so many others have been over the years, by his engaging intensity. We stayed in tou even after he was ousted from Apple. When he had something to pitch such as a NeXT computer or Pixar movie, the beam of his charm would suddenly refocus on me, and he would take me to a sushi restaurant in Lower Manhattan to tell me that whatever he was touting was the best thing he had ever produced. I liked him.",

Within twenty-four hours. his dehydration was so pronounced that a panickedBeverly took him to the emergency room. His temperature started rising hitting 105 degrees as he sweated a yellow halo of perspiration onto thehospitals sheets. He became delirious then violent yelling and pushing when nurses tried to insert an IV into his arm. Only after sedation was a physicianable to slide a long needle between two vertebra in the small of his back and extract a few drops of cerebrospinal fluid.The doctor performing the procedure sensed trouble immediately.The fluid surrounding the brain and spinal nerves is a barrier against infection andinjury. In healthy individuals it is clear and quick flowing moving with an almost silky rush through a needle. The sample from Eugene s spine was cloudyand dripped out sluggishly as if filled with microscopic grit.1.3 When the results came back from the laboratory Eugenes physicians learned why he was ill: He was suffering from viral encephalitis a disease caused by a relatively harmless virus that produces cold sores fever blisters and mild infections onthe skin. In rare cases, however the virus can make its way into the brain inflicting catastrophic damage as it chews through the delicate folds of tissuewhere our thoughts dreams—and according to some souls—reside.",

        "description": "Twenty years ago we began studying how people become wealthy.Initially, we did it just as you might imagine, by surveying people in so-called upscale neighborhoods across the country. In time, we dis-covered something odd. Many people who live in expensive homes and drive luxury cars do not actually have much wealth. Then, we discovered something even odder: Many people who have a great. deal of wealth do not even live in upscale neighborhoods.That small insight changed our lives. It led one of us, Tom Stanley,out of an academic career, inspired him to write three books on marketing to the affluent in America, and made him an advisor to corporations that provide products and services to the affluent. In addition,he conducted research about the affluent for seven of the top ten financial service corporations in America. Between us, we have conducted",
